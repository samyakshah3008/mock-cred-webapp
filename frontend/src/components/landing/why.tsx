        WHY behind MockCred!
      </div>
      <div className="text-center">
        Mock Interviews are so so encouraged before you appear for the real
        interviews. It is so common for candidate despite of knowing the concept
        they struggle in real interviews due to lack of interviewing skills.
        There are a few platforms out there like topmate where you can give mock
        interviews which is good and there are both free and paid services
        available. But on topmate or such platforms, they don't have a feature
        for audience to showcase their mock interview history, testimonials,
        strengths and weakness. This is exactly where MockCred took a birth!
      </div>
      <div className="text-center">
        MockCred is two-way platform unlike others. Imagine as Topmate, but for
        both audience and creators! ðŸ§¡ Now showcase how hard your are practicing
        in your job hunting phase! Instead of silent hard work, showcase
        publicly to everyone with your unique sharable profile where everyone
        can see how many mock interviews you have given, with whom you have
        given, how are the testimonials, what are your strengths and weakness.

      <div className="text-center">
        For those who want to only take interviews of someone, how MockCred will
        benefit them? In MockCred Version 2 (Coming soon...) monetization will
        be introduced just like Topmate. You can earn money by taking mock
        interviews or keep it free as per your choice. ðŸ§¡
      </div>
      <div className="text-center">
        Always believe in "Don't chase, rather attract opportunities!" Next time
        when you seek for a referral, along with your resume, let your MockCred
        profile speak for you! Your MockCred profile will speak that - you are
        prepared well for interviews and you have the attitude to constantly
        improve your skillset rather than yapping over x reasons why you are not
        getting a job! ðŸš€
