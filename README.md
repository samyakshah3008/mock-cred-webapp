## Welcome to MockCred!

Mock Interviews are so so encouraged before you appear for the real interviews. It is so common for candidate despite of knowing the concept they struggle in real interviews due to lack of interviewing skills. There are a few platforms out there like topmate where you can give mock interviews which is good and there are both free and paid services available. But on topmate or such platforms, they don't have a feature for audience to showcase their mock interview history, testimonials, strengths and weakness. This is exactly where MockCred took a birth!

MockCred is two-way platform unlike others. Imagine as Topmate, but for both audience and creators! ðŸ§¡ Now showcase how hard your are practicing in your job hunting phase! Instead of silent hard work, showcase publicly to everyone with your unique sharable profile where everyone can see how many mock interviews you have given, with whom you have given, how are the testimonials, what are your strengths and weakness.

For those who want to only take interviews of someone, how MockCred will benefit them? In MockCred Version 2 (Coming soon...) monetization will be introduced just like Topmate. You can earn money by taking mock interviews or keep it free as per your choice. ðŸ§¡

Always believe in "Don't chase, rather attract opportunities!" Next time when you seek for a referral, along with your resume, let your MockCred profile speak for you! Your MockCred profile will speak that - you are prepared well for interviews and you have the attitude to constantly improve your skillset rather than yapping over x reasons why you are not getting a job! ðŸš€
